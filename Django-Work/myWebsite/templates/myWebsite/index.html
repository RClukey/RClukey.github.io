        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Interdisciplinary Engineering is an engineering major at Texas A&M University that lets me design<br>
            my own degree plan. To create my Robotics Engineering degree major, I combined Mechanical Engineering<br>
            with Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as several other majors.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <header style="font-size: 30px;">Why Interdisciplinary Engineering?</header>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            At Texas A&M University, all engineers start their freshman year as general engineers and learn<br>
            about all the engineering majors that A&M has to offer. During this time, I already knew that I<br>
            wanted to work with robotics. I had spent much of my life before college fascinated with robots from<br>
            the smaller Roomba (iRobot) to the much more complex Spot (Boston Dynamics). However there were no<br>
            majors at Texas A&M University that were dedicated to robotics. <br><br>

            This is when I found Interdisciplinary Engineering. In the interdisciplinary engineering major, I was<br>
            able to create my own degree plan. I have taken a variety of classes throughout a variety of engineering<br>
            majors on campus, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to name<br>
            a few. By taking classes that focused on the mechanics of robots and the interactions between hardware and<br>
            software, I was able to create a degree program that centered around the motor control of robotic manipulators. <br><br>

            During my time at Texas A&M University, I have seen the reveal of Apollo (apptronik), Optimus (Tesla),<br>
            Robotic Craftsman (Machina Labs), and many others. I have also taken classes in Robotics Engineering<br>
            where I was able to work with multi-disciplinary teams to create various robotic machinery. The robots<br>
            that I have seen or made, have only increased my desire to be a part of the emerging field of<br>
            engineering that is Robotics Engineering.<br>
