            <p class="centered-text" style="width: 50%;">
                This metal sculpture is a 3-Dimensional representation of 
                the famous photo that Neil Armstrong took of Buzz Aldrin on 
                July 20, 1969 during Apollo 11. Neil Armstrong and the lunar 
                lander can be seen in the reflection of Buzz Aldrin's helmet.

            <p class="text-align-center" style="font-size: 14px;">Metal Earth Scupture of The Flying Dutchman</p>
            <p class="centered-text" style="width: 50%;">
                The Flying Dutchman was a legendary ghost ship that was said 
                to be doomed to sail the seas forever and that sighting the 
                ship was considered a portent of doom. The legendary ship is 
                believed to be a 17th-century Dutch fluyt. The phantom sightings 
                are believed to be caused by superior mirages from a ship sailing 
                on the horizon.

            <p class="text-align-center" style="font-size: 14px;">Metal Earth Scupture of the Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity Helicopter</p>
            <p class="centered-text" style="width: 50%;">
                The Perseverance rover is a Martian rover that landed in 
                the Jezero Crater on Mars in February 2021 to study the 
                ancient river delta for signs of past microbial life. The 
                Ingenuity helicopter was the first aircraft to make a sustained, 
                powered flight on another planet. It's first flight was on 
                April 19, 2021 and flew 72 times before the helicopter's 
                propellers were damaged. Ingenuity is currently being used 
                as a stationary weather station, documenting Martian weather 
                and dust patterns in the event that future rovers, aircraft, 
                or astronauts retrieve the helicopter.

            <img src="../files/Sauron.jpg" alt="Metal Earth Scupture of Sauron" width="350">
            <p class="text-align-center" style="font-size: 14px;">Metal Earth Scupture of Sauron</p>
            <p class="centered-text" style="width: 50%;">
                Sauron is the main antagonist of The Lord of the Rings 
                trilogy written by J.R.R. Martin. The sculpture is a 
                model of the film version of Sauron created by Weta 
                Workshop, New Line Cinema, and Peter Jackson for the 
                2001 blockbuster The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship 
                of the Ring. This scultpure includes the mace Sauron used 
                in the beginning of the movie during the prologue.
