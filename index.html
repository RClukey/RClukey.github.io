            <p class="text-align-center" style="font-size:35px;">I am a Robotics Engineer, graduated from Texas A&M University in May 2025, with a BSc Interdisciplinary Engineering.</p>

            <header style="font-size: 30px;">What is Interdisciplinary Engineering?</header>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Interdisciplinary Engineering is an engineering major at Texas A&M University that lets me design<br>
                my own degree plan. To create my Robotics Engineering degree major, I combined Mechanical Engineering<br>
                with Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as several other majors.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <header style="font-size: 30px;">Why Interdisciplinary Engineering?</header>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                At Texas A&M University, all engineers start their freshman year as general engineers and learn<br>
                about all the engineering majors that A&M has to offer. During this time, I already knew that I<br>
                wanted to work with robotics. I had spent much of my life before college fascinated with robots from<br>
                the smaller Roomba (iRobot) to the much more complex Spot (Boston Dynamics). However there were no<br>
                majors at Texas A&M University that were dedicated to robotics. <br><br>

                This is when I found Interdisciplinary Engineering. In the interdisciplinary engineering major, I was<br>
                able to create my own degree plan. I have taken a variety of classes throughout a variety of engineering<br>
                majors on campus, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to name<br>
                a few. By taking classes that focused on the mechanics of robots and the interactions between hardware and<br>
                software, I was able to create a degree program that centered around the motor control of robotic manipulators. <br><br>

                During my time at Texas A&M University, I have seen the reveal of Apollo (Apptronik), Optimus (Tesla),<br>
                Robotic Craftsman (Machina Labs), and many others. I have also taken classes in Robotics Engineering<br>
                where I was able to work with multi-disciplinary teams to create various robotic machinery. The robots<br>
                that I have seen or made, have only increased my desire to be a part of the emerging field of<br>
                engineering that is Robotics Engineering.<br>
