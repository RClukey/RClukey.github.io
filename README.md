# RClukey.github.io

This is my personal website. I coded this using what I learned in the CS50's Web Programming with HTML, Python, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Django-Work folder contains all my work I did using Python's Django framework to create the website.
All other folders and files are the complete and baked version of my Python Django work.
